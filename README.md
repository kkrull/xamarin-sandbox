# Xamarin Sandbox

A place to play with Xamarin.

Got an idea you want to try that's related to Xamarin, but you're not sure how or even _if_ it will work for your
project?

_No problem!_  Feel free to add new directories to this repository to try out your ideas.  Even if it doesn't work in
the end, it's still worthwhile to see what has been attempted.

There's not much structure to this repository, but that's by design.  The only suggestion is to try to limit each idea
to its own directory, separate from everything else.  That way, it's easier to tell if something is working or not.
